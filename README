ruby which: the linux "which" command re-written in ruby [and windows-friendly].

An executable locator (i.e. which or locate command) for windows that works!

Itch it scratches: there seems to be a lack of a "which" command for windows that actually work--they sometimes skip batch files entirely [batch file? what's that?] or don't list extensions, leaving you in doubt.  Despite running "which yyy" you never know what you're really running when you next run yyy in the command line--is it yyy.exe or some other yyy.bat that wasn't reported by "which"?  

Try it--you might really like it.

Usage:

   C:\>whichr ruby
   higher in the list will be executed first
   ./ruby.bat
   C:/Ruby/bin/ruby.exe
   c:/cygwin/bin/ruby.exe

   C:>whichr rub*
   higher in the list will be executed first
   c:/ruby/bin/rubigen
   c:/ruby/bin/rubigen.bat
   c:/ruby/bin/ruby.exe
   ...

Installation:

   C:\>gem install rogerdpack-whichr
  
   C:\>whichr executable_name_here [extension can be included, but is optional]
Enjoy.
