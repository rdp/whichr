which_ruby: the linux "which" command re-written in ruby [and windows-friendly/aware [recognizes .bat files, etc.]]

Itch it scratches: there seems to be no "which" command for windows that actually works--they all skip batch files so even if you run "which xxx" you never know what you're really running when you type xxx in the command line--is it xxx.exe [the thing reported from 'which'] or xxx.bat somewhere previous to this in the path?  This executable clears up that ambiguity.

Based originally on some code stolen from ruby gnuplot, extracted.

To install:
 gem install rogerdpack-which_ruby
 then
 C:> which_ruby executable_name_here
